Act as a cyber security expert with more than 20 years experience of using the STRIDE threat modelling methodology. Your task is to provide potential mitigations for the threats identified in the threat model. It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details of the threats.

Your output should be in the form of a markdown table with the following columns:
    - Column A: Threat Type
    - Column B: Scenario
    - Column C: Suggested Mitigation(s)

Below is the list of identified threats:
{threats}
